## Introduction
AiMeiMei Photo Editor is an AI-driven desktop application that empowers users to enhance and restore outdoor photos with intelligent tools. Built for usability and high-quality output, this editor integrates multiple advanced computer vision models to automate the image editing workflow.

‚ú® Key Features:
üéØ Human segmentation using U¬≤-Net for precise subject extraction.

üñºÔ∏è AI inpainting powered by LaMa and ControlNet to fill or extend missing or unwanted regions.

üîç Artifact detection and correction using FastFlow.

üåà Seamless blending with Deep Image Harmonization for natural-looking edits.

üßµ High-resolution output with Real-ESRGAN to upscale and enhance texture quality.

üìà Aesthetic and realism scoring using pretrained models to provide objective feedback on edit quality.

Whether you're fixing artifacts, removing photobombers, or extending a scenic background, AiMeiMei Photo Editor offers an end-to-end solution for clean, professional results with minimal manual effort.

## Installation

To get started, first install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install opencv-python numpy onnxruntime-gpu PyQt6 ultralytics diffusers realesrgan
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
pip install simple-lama-inpainting
```

## Special Requirements
- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** needs to be installed separately from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything).
- Ensure that your environment supports GPU for PyTorch and ONNXRuntime.

## Model Files
Download necessary AI model files from the following link:

[üì• Download Models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FO4ATC3l8Nfq-KXi0yXQfv8IAKvFJpX9/view?usp=sharing)

Extract and place these model files in the appropriate directory as specified in the application documentation.

## GPU Support
This application requires GPU support for optimal performance, especially for:
- **torch**
- **onnxruntime-gpu**

Ensure your environment supports CUDA before installation.

## Features
- 4K resolution enhancement using **RealESRGAN**
- AI-powered object extraction using **U2Net** and **SAM**
- Advanced AI-powered inpainting using **LaMa** and **ControlNet**
- Lighting adjustments, such as brightness, shadows, or contrast with **OpenCV**
- Photo filters powered by Pillgram
- Real-time guidance and suggestions for improving photo quality using **SPAQ** and position with **Yolo**(e.g., optimal positioning of the main subject)
